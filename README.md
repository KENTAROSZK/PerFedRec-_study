## Introduction
In this paper, we propose PerFedRec++, to enhance the personalized federated recommendation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we utilize the privacy-preserving mechanism of federated recommender systems to generate two augmented graph views, which are used as contrastive tasks in self-supervised graph learning to pre-train the model. Pre-training enhances the performance of federated models by improving the uniformity of representation learning. Also, by providing a better initial state for federated training, pre-training makes the overall training converge faster, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden. We then construct a collaborative graph to learn the client representation through a federated graph neural network. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users into different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster. Each user learns a personalized model by combining the global federated model, the cluster-level federated model, and its own fine-tuned local model.
